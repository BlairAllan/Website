Hey there!

My name is Blair Allan, and I'm an undergraduate studying Neuroscience. I am currently on a year long, industrial placement at the Centre for Applied Education Research in Bradford.

I love to solve problems. Whether it's spending 3 hours poking a small electrode into a snails brain trying to figure out why I'm not getting any recordings to self teaching code seeing *ERROR* it's a large part of who I am and what I enjoy working on. 

Alongside finding solutions, my greatest hobby is to travel. With a goal of mine being to visit every country. With the count currently being 24 out of 196 I have a while to go. 

I have created this website as a personal project, to create a space to share who I am and what I have been up too, especially in regards to my academic and career achievements. 



Wondering if I might be a good fit for your company?
