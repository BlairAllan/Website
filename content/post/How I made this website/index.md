title: 'How I made this Website'
---

This website is all created and edited/modified in RStudio. This is what I am currently most comfortable in using and just made it much easier to start with as I have limited HTML experience or creating a website in general.

I didn't create the website design itself; it's a reasonably popular Hugo Design called Academic, which is associated with Wowchemy. I took this design and imported it into Rstudio. 

After that, I created a Github repository for this website so that all the changes I made in RStudio would be pushed there. This is where Netlify gets all the information it needs to build and publish the website. 

While it may sound simple, being it my first project and myself having a limited understanding, I was pretty proud being able to get this all to work relatively quickly with only a short tutorial to help me troubleshoot an issue I had.
