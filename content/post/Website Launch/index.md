This is the first post of hopefully many where I have a space to talk and post what I get up too. The hope is to make this a place where you get to know me better, post about what I have previously done, what I am doing and what I am planning to do. 

One of the overall goals of this website is to use it to improve my chances of landing a job. With that in mind, a lot of the posts will be career focused with papers I have contributed too, courses I have completed and next year my dissipation. 

Another goal of mine is to use this as a space to demonstrate what I have taught myself in terms of coding. While writing this, my knowledge and experience of coding are relatively basic, and I am definitely in the beginner stages; however, I hope to work on this skill excessively due to recent enjoyment learning R.
